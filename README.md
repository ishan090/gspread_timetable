Program to look up information about school's timetable and schedule from google spreadsheets

A Triveni is basically like a club. This program was something I worked on for one such club.
It looks up the school timetable and finds out information about the next classes.

Everything from the concept to the actualization was pretty simple. Just learning about the gspread api
was something that was new.
